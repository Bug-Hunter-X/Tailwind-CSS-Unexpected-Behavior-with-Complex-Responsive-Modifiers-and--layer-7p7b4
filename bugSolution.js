/* Solution: Instead of complex nested responsive modifiers, create separate classes or use a more explicit approach.
   Avoid overly complex selectors within a @layer that are hard to interpret and may lead to unexpected behavior*/
<div class="bg-gray-100 md:bg-blue-500 lg:bg-green-700">

/* In your CSS or layer use more explicit selectors and avoid complex combinations */
