# Tailwind CSS Unexpected Behavior with Complex Responsive Modifiers and @layer

This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug in Tailwind CSS related to unexpected behavior when using complex responsive modifiers or custom directives in combination with `@layer` directives. The bug manifests as styles not applying correctly or conflicting unexpectedly.

## Bug Description
The issue arises when combining several responsive modifiers (e.g., `md:`, `lg:`, `xl:`) with custom directives or complex selectors within a `@layer` directive.  Tailwind's post-processing may not handle the combination correctly in certain scenarios, leading to unpredictable results.

## Reproduction Steps
1. Clone this repository.
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Run the application: `npm run dev`
4. Observe the unexpected styling in the browser.

## Solution
The solution involves restructuring the CSS or using a more straightforward approach to apply the styles.  See `bugSolution.js` for a possible workaround.
